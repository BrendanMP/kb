# Keyboard Battle 
Keyboard Battle (kb) is a two player party game played on the same keyboard. The winner of a round KB is the player who's word is successfully entered first.

### Rules
  * Player must complete their given word before the other player.
  * If the same letter is active and share the same index value both players advance on input.
  * If the same letter is active and a player has more matched characters than the other, the player with fewer matched characters receives that letter.
  * The game is over when a player completes 10 words.

### Bugs & Debugging
This is a work in progress, most of the logic is being tracked with console logs. I'm currently working on a bug that seems to be calling the gameover function multiple times.
