# Keyboard Battle 
Keyboard Battle (kb) is a two player party game played on the same keyboard. The winner of a round KB is the player who's word is successfully entered first.

## Rules
  * Player must complete their given word before the other player.
  * If the same letter is active and share the same index value both players advance on key input.
  * If the same letter is active and a player has more matched characters in their current word, the player with fewer matched characters receives that letter.
  * The game is over when the word list is exhausted.
